# PyBer_Analysis
#### Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a data summary that displays the relationship between total weekly fares in three different city types. By creating this data summary we can see city types and their total fare by creating a line plot to visually explain how they might correlate.

Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
#### Results
