# PyBer_Analysis
#### Overview:
The purpose of this analysis is to create a data summary that displays the relationship between total weekly fares in three different city types. By creating this data summary we can see city types and their total fare by creating a line plot to visually explain how they might correlate. Lastly, by addressing the correlations within the data, we can confront any possible disparities among the city types.

#### Results
- The first difference in ride-sharing data of different city types is the number of rides in the city. Rural cities had the least number of rides compared to Urban cities, where the total rides were 1,625. 
- Urban cities also had a larger number of total drivers compared to both Rural and Suburban cities. 
- Suburban cities seemed to be the median city type where their data was never higher than Urban cities and never lower than Rural city cities.
- Total fares in Urban cities were significanlty higher than other city types. Rural cities had $35,526 less total shares and Suburban cities had $20,498 less total shares compared to Urban cities.
- Looking at the averages of fare per ride, Rural cities were the most expensive compared to Urban and Suburban cities.
- The city type with the largest average fare per driver was also Rural. 
- Rural cities also had the least amount of drivers which affect the number of rides.
- For all three city types, May appears to be the month that has the highest Total fare.

#### Summary
Based on the results, I recommend the CEO to pay attention to Rural cities, they have the least amount of rides compared to Suburban and Urban cities. Secondly, both  Rural and Suburban cities need more driver support in order to increase the number of rides and generate more revenue. Lastly, I recommend the CEO to take a look into the Average fare per ride and per driver in Urban cities. Dispite Urban cities having a larger number of rides, fares, and drivers; Rural and Suburban cities have larger fare per ride/driver averages compared to Urban cities.
